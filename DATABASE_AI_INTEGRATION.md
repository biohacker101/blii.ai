## 🔍 **How Database Integration Works**

### **When You Send a Message in AI Mode:**

1. **🔎 Database Scanning**
   ```
   → Retrieves all your saved content (up to 100 most recent)
   → Extracts keywords from your query using AI
   → Searches across content, analysis, and tags
   → Finds semantically related items
   ```

2. **📊 Context Analysis**
   ```
   → Generates summary of your content patterns
   → Analyzes your organizational preferences
   → Identifies relevant saved items
   → Builds comprehensive context
   ```

3. **🧠 AI Response Generation**
   ```
   → Uses full database context for responses
   → References specific saved content
   → Makes connections between items
   → Provides personalized insights
   ```

### **Database Context Structure:**
```typescript
interface DatabaseContext {
  recentMessages: ChatMessage[];     // Recent conversation
  relevantContent: ChatMessage[];    // Content matching your query
  contentSummary: string;           // Overview of all your content
  userPatterns: string;             // Your usage and organization patterns
}
```

## 🎯 **Real-World Examples**

### **Intelligent Content Discovery**
```
User: "What photos did I save from my vacation?"

Database Search:
→ Extracts keywords: ["photos", "vacation", "travel", "trip"]
→ Searches images with travel-related content/tags
→ Finds relevant saved items

AI Response: "You saved several vacation photos! I found images of beautiful purple bougainvillea flowers in a garden setting, and a landscape photo with vibrant colors. These were tagged with 'Landscape' and appear to be from outdoor locations. Would you like me to help you organize these travel photos better?"
```

### **Cross-Content Connections**
```
User: "Connect my work documents with project planning"

Database Search:
→ Finds all work-related documents
→ Identifies project planning materials
→ Analyzes patterns and relationships

AI Response: "I found 3 work documents and 2 project planning files in your database. Your Q4 sales report connects to your business planning spreadsheet - both focus on quarterly performance. I also see you frequently tag work items with 'Important' and 'Project'. Would you like me to suggest a better organization system?"
```

### **Content Pattern Analysis**
```
User: "How do I organize my content better?"

Database Analysis:
→ Analyzes all saved content (47 items)
→ Identifies preferences (mostly images, frequent 'work' tags)
→ Reviews organizational patterns

AI Response: "Based on your 47 saved items, you primarily save images (67%) and frequently use tags like 'work', 'important', and 'personal'. I notice you're great at tagging but could benefit from more specific categories. Consider creating sub-tags like 'work-reports', 'work-meetings' for better organization. You also have several landscape photos that could be grouped under 'travel' or 'nature'."
```

  tag,
  COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM chat_messages, 
     UNNEST(tags) as tag
WHERE user_id = ? AND tags IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tag
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Content Search with AI Analysis:**
```sql
-- Search across content and AI analysis
SELECT *
FROM chat_messages 
WHERE user_id = ?
  AND (
    content ILIKE ?
